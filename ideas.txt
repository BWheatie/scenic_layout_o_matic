New Layout paradigm

Set screen layout and apply primitives to to established layout
* ?? how can you define a layout without primitives??
    * It can continue to be used the same way but using new opts
* Flex.layout(graph, group_id, starting_point)
    * Need to figure out what the bounding box is:
        * order based? First id is the bounding box
        
    * Map.get(graph, group_id)
    * ids

Layout without primitive ids

Rewrite group layout: pass in group, Get group primitives from graph. 
* how to define which primitive is bounding box
* opts:
    * max container
    * reflow
    * align
    * resize to fit
    * layout direction(x, y, left, right, up, down)
    * justify
    * padding
    * padding direction
